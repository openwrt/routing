Subject: batman-adv: Fix own OGM check in aggregated OGMs

The own OGM check is currently misplaced and can lead to the following
issues:

For one thing we might receive an aggregated OGM from a neighbor node
which has our own OGM in the first place. We would then not only skip
our own OGM but erroneously also any other, following OGM in the
aggregate.

For another, we might receive an OGM aggregate which has our own OGM in
a place other then the first one. Then we would wrongly not skip this
OGM, leading to populating the orginator and gateway table with ourself.

The latter seems to not only be a cosmetic issue, but there were reports
that this causes issues with various subsystems of batman-adv, too. For
instance there were reports about issues with DAT and either disabling
DAT or aggregation seemed to solve it.

Fixing these issues by applying the own OGM check not on the first OGM
in an aggregate but for each OGM in an aggregate instead.
