/*
    IPC integration of babeld with OpenWrt.

    The ubus interface offers following functions:
    - get_info
    - get_neighbours
    - get_xroutes
    - get_routes

    All output is divided into IPv4 and IPv6.

    Ubus notifications are sent if we receive updates for
    - xroutes
    - routes
    - neighbours

    The format is:
    - {route,xroute,neighbour}.add: Object was added
    - {route,xroute,neighbour}.change: Object was changed
    - {route,xroute,neighbour}.flush: Object was flushed
